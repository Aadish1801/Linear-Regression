# Linear-Regression

### Building a Linear Regression Machine Learning Model from Scratch Using NumPy and Basic Python Functions

**Motivation:**
- To gain a deep understanding of linear regression by implementing the algorithm using basic Python functions and NumPy, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries.

**Why build this project:**
- To enhance programming and mathematical skills by understanding and coding the underlying mechanics of linear regression from scratch.

**Problem solved:**
- Provides a hands-on approach to building, training, and evaluating a linear regression model, demonstrating the step-by-step process and key concepts.

**Learning outcomes:**
- Developed a thorough understanding of linear regression, including the calculation of slope, intercept, and prediction using basic programming constructs.

**Project highlights:**
- Implementation of a custom linear regression class with methods for fitting the model to training data, making predictions, and calculating coefficients.
- Use of NumPy for efficient numerical computations, ensuring the model handles large datasets effectively.
- Visualization of the regression line against the training data, providing a clear depiction of model performance and accuracy.
- Detailed explanation and implementation of the ordinary least squares method to derive the best-fit line.
